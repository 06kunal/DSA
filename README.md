# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with Python

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms practice using Python**, focused on building strong problem-solving skills and preparing for **technical interviews and competitive exams**.

---

## Objectives

* Build strong fundamentals in **DSA using Python**
* Understand concepts through **clean code + recursion/iteration logic**
* Improve problem-solving and coding confidence
* Prepare for **interviews, coding rounds, and CS fundamentals**

---

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Editor:** VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## Topics Covered / Planned

* Recursion (base cases, tail vs non-tail)
* Arrays & Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stack & Queue
* Trees & Binary Trees
* Graphs (BFS, DFS)
* Sorting & Searching
* Sliding Window, Two Pointers
* Greedy Algorithms
* Basic Dynamic Programming

---

## Coding Style

* Clear variable names
* Step-by-step logic
* Comments for important ideas
* Focus on **readability over shortcuts**

---

## How to Run

```bash
